This folder does not contain the Jamaica microdata or the VCQI augmented dataset, because that dataset holds the survey microdata.

If you make the survey data compatible with VCQI, modify the control program and point the code in Block B to the folders on your computer and you will reproduce the output that you find here (as well as the augmented dataset).
